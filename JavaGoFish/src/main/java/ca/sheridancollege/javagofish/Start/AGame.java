/**
 * AGAME ABSTRACT CLASS:
 * ---------------------
 * 
 * 
 * A top level class for modeling generic card games. We'll subtype other Game objects from this class 
 * making this a template then. We may have Black Jack and Rummy in the future. We could be asked to make 
 * another card game and we don't want to start from scratch. So, we abstract common attributes among card
 * games here. Not right now, that will be expanded on later. For now it's just a class we designated
 * as the Game template. An instance like Black Jack or Big Two can extend this class. 
 *
