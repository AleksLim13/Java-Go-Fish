This is a digital Card game written in Java. It models how two players would play Go Fish in real life. The computer has to do some thinking for itself to know what cards to ask for. More could be improved on for the AI's thought process. Sheridan College taught me how to think more object oriented and build my programming skills. It was an assignment looking to evaluate my abilities to think in a object oriented way and my depth of understanding of each part of the Java language. A card game calls for pretty much everything in the Java language to be performed with a sophisticated level of skill. Completinf different card games is a good idea for the student programmer who's about to go hunting for a job to build a online github portfolio to have prospective emlployers look through. Loops, control structures, method encapsulations, object relationships, arrays, inheritance, and polymorphism are requirements for any worthy finished product to be produced. The TurnController is the heart of the application as it puts all the pieces together to make the game go. It could have more interfaces for more of the functionality of the game.
