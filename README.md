This is a digital Card game written in Java. It models how two players would play Go Fish in real life. Sheridan College taught me how to think more object oriented and build my programming skills. It was an assignment looking to evaluate my abilities to think in a object oriented way and my depth of understanding of each part of the Java language. A card game calls for pretty much everything in the Java language to be performed with a sophisticated level of skill. Loops, control structures, method encapsulations, objecs relationships, arrays, inheritance, polymorphism are requirements for any worthy finished roduct to be produced.
